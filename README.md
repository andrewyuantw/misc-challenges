### About
This is a repo for miscellaneous coding challenge questions I've completed that either were useful, interesting, or challenging.

### Overview 

* BraceChecker.java (Checks if an expression uses (), [], {} correctly, meaning one open brace always have one closed brace)
* Calculator.java (Evaluates a mathematical expression with correct priority rules - PEMDAS)
* FirstNonRepeatingLetter.py (Finds the first non-repeating letter in a string)
* MatrixDeterminant.java (Evaluates any square matrix's determinant)
* MaximumSubarraySum.java (Finds the maximum sum of any consecutive integers in an integer array)
* Snail.java (Prints out the contents of a 2D array in a spiral pattern)
* Spiralizor.java (Generates a 2D array that creates a spiral pattern by populating an 2D array of chosen size with 0s and 1s)
* StripComments.py (Strips away comments from a string)
